# brblog
A minimalistic web log written in Python on top of Flask, SQLite3 and jinja2.

## Minimalisme
It is so shockingly minimalistic, you can't even modify a post once it has been submitted. Seriously, better think about something new than to reflect on the past (you can kill or hide it, okay).  The "design" is all about the content -- there's only stuff you put online with the absolute minimum of bells and wistles.

## Installation
See INSTALL.
